| System Description                | Diegetic Graphical User Interface<br>Robot Platform: A Franka Emika Panda arm, controlled via a PC running Ubuntu 20 with a real-time kernel through Ethernet. Robotic operations run at 200Hz. Diegetic buttons and markers are printed on paper and pasted on card stock, attached to the Franka Arm with Velcro. External buttons are positioned on a small acrylic platform. The Panda robot arm is positioned opposite the user, with the end effector about 50 cm away and 10 cm lower than the user’s head. Control buttons are placed on the table next to the cubes, within a workspace constrained to a box roughly 40 cm in depth, 30 cm in width, and 20 cm in height, centered on the template and marked with safety tape.<br>Gripper: Franka Hand<br>Control Hardware: The main control device is Tobii Pro Glasses 2, a head-mounted gaze-tracking device providing real-time video and eye data streaming at 50Hz. It offers 3D and 2D gaze positions and an external camera view for processing. The glasses are connected to the computer via Wi-Fi.<br>Software: ROS 2 Foxy used as middleware, with nodes running on multiple Docker containers with different environments: one for the Tobii Pro Glasses 2 connection and visual processing, another for the MoveIt2 velocity-based controller and robot configuration, and a third for the FrankaROS 2 environment.<br>Control Strategy: The Diegetic Graphical User Interfaces (D-GUI) uses interactive buttons in the real world which the user can trigger via gaze instead of a screen. The buttons are paired with one or more fiducial markers, which can be reconfigure in real time.                                                                                                                                                                |                                     |                                       |       |            |       |                     |  |
| Comments                          | Experimental Procedure: 21 user trials with the Franka Emika Panda arm controlled via eye-gaze using our Diegetic Graphical User Interface (D-GUI) system were done. The experiment was preceeded by a brief familiarization stage, controlling the robot by looking at buttons and picking up and placing a cube. System Usability Score and NASA-TLX were also measured after the test.<br>Results: User experience was rated highly, with participants finding the system easy to learn and use. Fatigue was noted, particularly due to the placement of grasping controls. The 5th cube was noticeably slower to grab, as participants usually had to move the robot arm from one end of the template to the opposite to resume pick-up. Cubes farther away from the users were usually the last ones reached during the experiment.<br>Discussion: This setup eliminates the need for context-switching between external screens and the robot, allowing the use of larger interactive elements and reducing the need for precise gaze systems. Users quickly adapted to the system, requiring minimal explanation and habituation time. Users were observed to move their heads during the experiment to keep the robot end-effector in view, which could make the system less applicable to individuals with tetraplegia.<br>Incidents: Trial 21 stopped midway due to eye strain with two blocks unpositioned, counted as misplaced. Trial 12 participant triggered the robot emergency stop by driving the robot against the table. Due to illumination changes or glasses slippage three participants requested to recalibrate the glasses during the test, briefly pausing the timer. Issues with robot responsiveness at the stencil's edge or emergency stops required brief pauses and realignment before continuing. |                                     |                                       |       |            |       |                     |  |
